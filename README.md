Pie21 is a web client for [e621](https://e621.net/) made in HTML, CSS, JS, and JSON.

## Insatlling
If you would like to install open a terminal and run the following command if you are on [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and I would recommend [Fedora](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/Fedora-Remix-for-WSL) as that's what it's made on.
```bash
blah blah blah not here rn UwU :) 
```

once you are installed run the following command in the place you installed it to
```bash
node proxy.js
```
